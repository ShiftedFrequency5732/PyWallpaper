# PyWallpaper
Python script, for fetching random wallpapers from the web, for Windows OS.\
There are two versions, one that grabs image from Unsplash, and one that grabs Microsoft's daily Bing image.

You can use these scripts, in conjunction with Task Scheduler, in Windows OS.\
You can set-up a task, that repeats daily, or at startup, or at certain interval, to change wallpaper.

## Disclaimer
It is recommended, if you will use this in conjunction with Task Scheduler, it is recommended to use `.pyw` instead of `.py` extension.\
That is because, python script with `.py` extension, will launch in console, and `.pyw` won't.
